# Python Async Comprehension

## Asynchronous comprehensions in Python are a feature that allows you to use the async for construct inside list, set, and dictionary comprehensions, as well as generator expressions. This feature was introduced in Python 3.6 with PEP 530.

## Python 3.6 added the ability to create Asynchronous Comprehensions and Asynchronous Generators. You can read about asynchronous comprehension in PEP 530 while the asynchronous generators are described in PEP 525. The documentation states that you can now create asynchronous list, set and dict comprehensions and generator expressions.
